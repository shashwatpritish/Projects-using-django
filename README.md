## FAQ

#### What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It allows developers to build robust web applications quickly by providing built-in features like an ORM, authentication, and an admin panel.

#### How do I set up a Django project?
To set up a Django project:

Install Django via pip: pip install Django.
Create a new project using the command: django-admin startproject projectname.
Navigate into your project directory: cd projectname.
Start the development server: python manage.py runserver.
#### What is a Django app?
A Django app is a self-contained module that performs a specific function within a project. Each app can have its own models, views, and templates, and can be reused in different projects.

#### How do I create a new app?
To create a new app, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
python manage.py startapp appname
```
5. How do I connect my Django app to a database?
Django supports various databases. To connect your app:

Open settings.py.
Modify the DATABASES setting with your database configuration. For example, for SQLite:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}
```
#### How do I create a model?
To create a model:

Open the models.py file in your app.
Define a class that inherits from models.Model. For example:
```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
#### How do I migrate my database?
To apply your model changes to the database:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
to create migration files.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
``` 
to apply them.

#### What is the Django admin panel?
The Django admin panel is a built-in interface that allows you to manage your database records easily. To use it, ensure you have created a superuser with python manage.py createsuperuser, and then access the admin panel at /admin.

#### How do I serve static files in production?
In production, serve static files using a dedicated web server (like Nginx or Apache). Update your settings.py to define STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT, and collect static files using:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```
#### How can I deploy my Django application?
Common deployment options include:

- Heroku: Simple and integrates well with Git.
- DigitalOcean: Provides more control and customization.
- AWS: Offers scalable options for larger applications.

#### What are Django middleware?
Middleware is a way to process requests globally before they reach your views or responses before they reach the client. You can add or modify middleware in the MIDDLEWARE setting in settings.py.

#### How can I handle user authentication?
Django provides a built-in authentication system. You can use:

django.contrib.auth for user management.
Create login and registration views using the built-in views or custom ones.
Use Djangoâ€™s decorators to protect views.

#### What is the Django REST Framework?
Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs. It simplifies the process of creating RESTful APIs in Django.

#### Where can I find help and documentation?
You can find official Django documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/ Community support is also available on platforms like Stack Overflow and the Django subreddit.
